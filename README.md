## Credits

Thank you [Erikku](https://github.com/erikku/), the original creator of this tool. Unfortunately, they do not seem to be maintaining the project anymore, so I had to fork it.

I have also gotten bug fixes from rustinlee, Nephthysred, and dsyfo from their forks of the project.

I have also used the fusion chart data from https://github.com/aqiu384/megaten-fusion-tool to fix errors in the original fusion chart.
