"<p>I strongly suggest that " + htmlDemonLink("Napaea") + " be your first or second contracted demon. A single round of battle can easily leave you inches from death. Save after you contract each demon. Try to avoid actual battle during this process. When scouting, try not to give up too many items. You can use the \"Cheat\" option to avoid this; however, note that using this multiple times in a conversation usually does not work. If you fail and lose items, I suggest reloading and trying again as opposed to wasting your HP, MP, and items. Remember that if the conversation failed and the demon leaves, if you didn't burn a lot of items you will have gained free experience! Once you have a full party, you should have enough press turns for normal combat.</p>" +
